        async with Client(host='localhost') as client:
            await client.send_report(
                host='hal3000',
                service="AE35",
                state=State.WARNING,
                message=(
                    "I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit.\n"
                    "It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours",
                )
            )
